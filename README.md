# plane_look_up
This file was created base on my curirous because I dont see any application that show me how to find the plane's information

To use this:
1. Install python (lol)
2. Install pillow as:
   - pip install pillow
   - wait the computer doing things
3. Open the tkinter library and from the PIL you import the Image, ImageTk
4. Just replace 'path' on line 239 to your image-path then hit the Run
5. Enjoy my firt version of the Plane Lookup
